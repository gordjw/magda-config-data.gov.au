Data.gov.au is the central source of Australian open government data.

Anyone can access the anonymised public data published by federal, state and local government agencies.

You are encouraged to search and reuse the data on data.gov.au. This data is a national resource that holds considerable value for growing the economy, improving service delivery and transforming policy outcomes.

Find out more [about open data](https://blog.data.gov.au/about-open-data).

In addition to government data, you can also find publicly-funded research data and datasets from private institutions that are in the public interest.

The site has over 30,000 publically available datasets and continues to grow. The federal government’s <a href="https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/aust_govt_public_data_policy_statement_1.pdf" target="_blank">public data policy statement<span class="visuallyhidden"> Opens in new window</span></a> requires all government agencies to make non-sensitive data open by default.

In addition to free, open datasets, data.gov.au now includes information about unpublished data and data available for purchase.

### Visualising data

Many of the data sets can be visualised using the in-built mapping tools.

Datasets that contain a geospatial field (such as latitude and longitude)can be mapped and viewed in <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/" target="_blank">NationalMap<span class="visuallyhidden"> Opens in new window</span></a>.

### Contact us

Contact the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) at [data@digital.gov.au](mailto:data@digital.gov.au) for support related to data.gov.au and NationalMap.

Let us know how you are using government data or if you want to contribute to our [blog](http://blog.data.gov.au/) about public data and data.gov.au.

Please do not include any unnecessary personal, financial or sensitive information.

Information will only be used for purposes for which your provide it. Please see our Privacy policy for further information.

### How do I register or upload data

Anyone can [register an account](https://data.gov.au/user/register) on data.gov.au which can be used for commenting or liking datasets.

But to publish government data you must have an account with an Australian Government email address (ending with “.gov.au”).

Before you consider registering an account for a government (federal, state, local) or government-funded research agency, you should do a quick search of existing [organisations](https://search.data.gov.au/organisations) to see if your own agency is already listed. The listed contact can help you to log in and publish your data sets. If not, you can register for the first time.

### Development

Data.gov.au was transferred from the Department of Premier and Cabinet to the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA). The redeveloped platform MAGDA was developed in  partnership with CSIRO <a href="http://data61.csiro.au" target="_blank">Data61<span class="visuallyhidden"> Opens in new window</span></a>.

MAGDA (Making Australian Government Data Available) is a fully open source project.

title: Dataset Quality

## How we calculate open data quality

Our open data quality ratings are an automatic rating based on the licensing, format and availability of data, derived from (but different to) Tim Berners-Lee’s [5-star linked data system](https://www.w3.org/2011/gld/wiki/5_Star_Linked_Data).

A dataset is given the rating of its best file or API – for example, if a dataset has 3 files rated at 1 star, 2 stars and 3 stars, the whole dataset will have a 3-star rating. The criteria for each star rating is described below.

We will continue to update the data quality rating as research continues. If you have any feedback – particularly if you feel that a certain dataset has been misclassified – please contact us at [data@digital.gov.au](mailto:data@digital.gov.au).

### ⭐ Is the data available on the web, and does it have an open license?

This has two components – whether we were able to successfully check that the URL for the data is working, and whether its declared license matched our list of open licenses.

When a dataset is indexed by [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/), we automatically check every file or API link to make sure it’s not broken. The link will be marked as broken if it doesn’t respond (and times out), returns an error or not found HTTP code, requires a login to access, doesn’t support an HTTP HEAD request, or rate-limits our crawler without returning the correct HTTP code (429) so that we know to slow down our requests.

If a dataset’s links are all broken it will be marked as zero stars.

The list of data licenses that we consider to be open is based on [the opendefinition.org list of Conformant Licenses](https://opendefinition.org/licenses/). You can find the list we use [here](https://github.com/TerriaJS/magda/blob/master/magda-minion-linked-data-rating/src/openLicenses.ts).

Essentially, if a dataset declares a license field with text containing one of those licenses (for example,  “CC0” contains “CC”), then we assume that it’s open.

### ⭐⭐ Is the data available as structured, machine-readable data?

To get 2 stars, the data must qualify for 1-star and also be structured and machine-readable. So data contained in images, plain text, Microsoft Word documents and Portable Document Files (PDF) do not qualify, but machine readable formats such as Microsoft Excel files do.

We determine this by comparing the file’s format against a list of formats that we understand to be 2-star formats – you can see the list [here](https://github.com/TerriaJS/magda/blob/master/magda-minion-linked-data-rating/src/openFormats.ts#L2).

### ⭐⭐⭐ Is it available in a non-proprietary format?

To get 3 stars, the data must qualify for 2-star (machine-readable) but also be available in a [non-proprietary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/non-proprietary) format. For example, plain comma-separated values (CSV), JSON and XML documents are all formats that are in the public domain or open standards, while a Microsoft Access MDB file is not.

We determine this by comparing the file’s format against a list of formats that we understand to be 3-star formats – you can see the list [here](https://github.com/TerriaJS/magda/blob/master/magda-minion-linked-data-rating/src/openFormats.ts#L3).

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Does the data declare a schema?

To get 4 stars, data must not only be available in a non-proprietary, machine readable format, but also specify some kind of schema – meaning the data isn’t just readable by machines, but also includes metadata that allows it to be understood by machines. This usually means that it’s specified in an open, Linked Data format that includes the schema inside the data such as [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) or [JSON-LD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD), or uses a non-proprietary format that enforces a schema, such as [CSV GEO AU](https://github.com/TerriaJS/nationalmap/wiki/csv-geo-au).

Currently we determine this by comparing the file’s format against a list of formats that we understand to be 4-star formats – you can see the list [here](https://github.com/TerriaJS/magda/blob/master/magda-minion-linked-data-rating/src/openFormats.ts#L21).

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Does the data link to other data?

5-star datasets are those that link to other data – for example, a dataset that included “Canberra” as a value for something wouldn’t simply include the word “Canberra”, but a link to data about Canberra, [such as its record in Geonames](http://sws.geonames.org/2172517/about.rdf).

5-star datasets are very rare, and our automated process (currently) is not yet able to determine which datasets qualify for 5 stars.
